    <h5>Project 1 : Thermal Analysis Of Corrugated And Perforated Fins</h5>
    <h6>2022 BE Final Year Project.</h6>
    <p>
      Project Desription : The corrugated fin one of most widely used technique
      in plate fin, where high thermal performance is needed. In the present
      paper, the main focus is on how the perforation and corrugation will
      affect the thermal performance of heat sink.

    <h5>Project 2 : Power Generation By Suspension System</h5>
    <h6>2019 Diploma Final Year Project.</h6>
    <p>
      Project Desription : The power generator electromagnetic suspension system
      is a system that converts vehicle bump generated linear motion &
      vibration, into electricity to be used in battery charging. General
      vehicle shock absorbers are used to simply absorb this energy without
      converting it to electricity.
